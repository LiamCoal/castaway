## What is Castaway?

Castaway is a game engine using OpenGL. You can use it to make 3D graphics
applications with .NET Core. It supports custom shaders, `Level`s,
`Quaternion`s, and a bunch more. Castaway isn't ready though, there
is still a lot of work to be done, and my programming is almost certainly
not bug free.

## Using Castaway

Castaway has a number of NuGet packages published to GitHub packages. You
will need `Castaway.OpenGL` to use castaway. It includes an OpenGL implementation
for the Castaway Graphics API, as well as depending on everything else you need.

Check out the `Test` project for an example of use.
